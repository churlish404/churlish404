## Hey I'm Luca 🤘 

I've recently completed the _nology full-stack software enginerring course where I learned the fundamentals of a whole host of frontend and backend technologies see below for details 🙌

Currently working on a project called ShroomRoom - a full stack application with CRUD functionality that will allow users to add mushrooms to their "basket" if they have found them in the wild and upload an image.

I'm also looking to collaborate on some projects and explore other languages (Python, C++) reach out if you have any questions or would like to work on something together
